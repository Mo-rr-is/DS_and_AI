This repository contains files on basics to Data Science and Machine Learning.
It also contains notes and learning programs of what was covered during the **DSAIL Summer School** at **Dedan Kimathi University of Technology**.

## Intro to Computer Vision ML using YOLOv8
- Computer Vision, a branch of artificial intelligence, utilizes machine learning and neural networks to guide computers in extracting valuable insights from digital images, videos, and visual data.
- There are many variations of computer vision, including, ```Image Classification```, ```Object Detection```, and ```Instance Segmentation```.
- **Prequisites:**
  - Basics of Python Programming.
  - A Google Colab account.
    - A hosted Jupyter Notebook service that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.
  - A Roboflow account.
    - A conversion tool for computer vision datasets.
  - A Hugging Face account.
    - Develops computation tools for building applications using machine learning.
### A. Image Classification with YOLOv8
- Start with Image Classification prediction using pretrained ```yolov8-cls```model. {*classification_zero_shot.ipynb*}
- Download the dataset and unzip.
- Login to roboflow and create a single-label classification project.
